Welcome to Hangman!
The player starts by picking a category,
then a word is randomly selected to be guessed.
The player guesses either 1 letter, or the entire word.
If they guess a letter that is not in the hidden word,
a body part is added. If the entire body is built
(head, body, legs, and arms) before the player guesses
the entire word, the game ends.
